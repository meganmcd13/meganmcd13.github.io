        This was my first foray into making garments, and I'm so happy with how it turned out! I used a cotton/bamboo blend of yarn and followed this <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/soho-top-2" target="_blank">pattern</a> from Ravelry. I added a second color for the bottom and trim. This project was a great learning experience, as my first knitted item! </p>
